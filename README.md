# owlet
An experimental balanced ternary architecture for ternary software development with a syntax similar to C and Lua. This crate includes the AST interpreter able to decode and run Owlet programs. This is not a full emulator, but it's intended to be used as a library/language for other applications to use.

owlet has a dependancy on [peterolson/BigInteger.js](https://github.com/peterolson/BigInteger.js/) to print numbers and the [parsimmon](http://github.com/jneen/parsimmon/) for the parsing combinator, with no additional dependencies.

# Status
This is work in progress.
