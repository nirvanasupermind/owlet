# owlet
An experimental ternary AST-based language with C/Lua-style syntax. This crate includes the interpreter able to decode and run Owlet programs. This is not a full emulator, but it's intended to be used as a library for other applications to use. And it has those dependencies:
* [BigInteger.js](https://github.com/peterolson/BigInteger.js/)
* [myna-parser](http://github.com/cdiggins/myna-parser/)
# Syntax



# Status
The language work in progress, the not fully designed and there are some tests.
